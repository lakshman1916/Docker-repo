what we are doing in docker ??

--> first we are pulling an image from docker hub by using command 
--> after that we are creating a container based on that image 
--> we are running the container on a specific port
--> after that we are trying to create our own image for this we are writing a demo HTML file (saving it in the form of "index.html") and we are writing a Docker file
    (saving it in the form of "Dockerfile") 
--> we are building the image by using the build command, after that we are running one more container with the custom image on a different port
